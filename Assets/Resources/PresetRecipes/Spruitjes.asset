  description: "1. Trim the Brussels and peel away any tatty outer leaves, halving
    any larger ones and keeping the smaller ones whole. Cook in a large pan of boiling
    salted water for 5 minutes, then drain and leave to steam dry. \n\n2. Melt the
    butter in a large frying pan on a medium-low heat. Pick and add half the sage
    leaves, cook for 3 minutes, or until crispy, then tip into a small bowl. \n\n3.
    Place the pan back on the heat and squeeze the sausage meat from the skins directly
    into the pan, breaking it up with the back of a spoon. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes,
    until golden and crispy, while you peel and finely slice the onion, and pick
    and finely chop the remaining sage. \n\n4. Add the onion and chopped sage to
    the pan and cook for 5 minutes on a medium-high heat, or until the onions have
    softened, stirring occasionally. \n\n5. Peel and core the apple, then finely
    dice. Tip into the pan, and add the sprouts too, then add the Worcestershire
    sauce and toss until hot through. \n\n6. Transfer to a serving platter, scatter
    over the crispy sage leaves, and dig in!  \n\nTip: For a veggie-friendly version,
    swap the sausages for chopped chestnuts, and use anchovy-free Worcestershire
    sauce."
