  description: "Ingredients\r\n2 aubergines , (250g each)\r\n1 bunch of mint , (30g)\r\n20
    g skin-on almonds\r\n1 lemon\r\n1 tablespoon runny honey\r\nextra virgin olive
    oil\r\n8 mixed-colour olives , (stone in)\r\n40 g feta cheese\r\n100 g bag of
    mixed salad\n\nPreheat the oven to 180\xB0C/350\xB0F/gas 4. Prick the aubergines
    and place directly on the bars of the oven. Roast for 50 minutes, or until beautifully
    soft, tender and juicy.\r\n\r\nPick the baby mint leaves and put aside. Pick
    the rest of the leaves into a pestle and mortar, then add the almonds and roughly
    crush and pound together. Finely grate in the lemon zest, squeeze in the juice,
    and muddle in with the honey and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Squash
    and destone the olives, tear the flesh into the mix, and crumble in the feta.
    Mix it all together, then season to perfection with black pepper. Divide the
    salad and baby mint leaves between your plates. Slice the soft aubergines down
    the middle and place on top, then smother with the incredible, moreish pesto-style
    dressing. I like to attack the whole thing, chopping, tossing and mixing everything
    together as I tuck in. Delicious hot or cold."
