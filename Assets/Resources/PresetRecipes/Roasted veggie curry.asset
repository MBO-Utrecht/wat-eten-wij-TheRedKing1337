  description: "Ingredients\r\n1 heaped teaspoon Madras curry paste\r\nolive oil\r\nred
    wine vinegar\r\n1 parsnip\r\n2 carrots\r\n\xBD a butternut squash , (600g)\r\n1
    courgette\r\n200 g frozen cauliflower\r\n4 cm piece of ginger\r\n2 cloves of
    garlic\r\n2 tablespoons good mango chutney\r\n1 x 400 g tin of quality plum tomatoes\r\n1
    x 400 g tin of light coconut milk\r\n100 g frozen peas\r\nSTUFFED NAAN\r\n1 small
    knob of unsalted butter\r\n6 cloves\r\n\xBD a cinnamon stick\r\n1 small leek\r\n300
    g frozen spinach\r\n2 mugs (600g) of self-raising flour , plus extra for dusting\r\n100
    g feta cheese\n\nMethod\r\nPreheat the oven to 200\xBAC/400\xBAF/gas 6.\r\nIn
    a large roasting tray, mix the curry paste with a pinch of sea salt, 2 tablespoons
    of oil and 1 tablespoon of vinegar.\r\nWash the parsnip, carrots and butternut
    squash (we\u2019re leaving the skins on). Quarter the parsnip lengthways, remove
    the fluffy core and chop into bite-sized chunks (about 2cm), adding to the tray
    as you go.\r\nRepeat with the courgette, then chop up the carrots. Deseed the
    squash and chop to a similar size. Get it all in the tray with the cauliflower
    and mix until well coated.\r\nRoast the veg for 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden,
    gnarly and cooked through.\r\nMeanwhile, for the sauce, put a large shallow casserole
    pan on a medium heat. Peel and finely chop the ginger and garlic, and place in
    the pan with 1 tablespoon of oil, stirring regularly.\r\nAs soon as it starts
    to colour, stir in the mango chutney. Let it sizzle for a minute, then pour in
    the tomatoes, breaking them up with your spoon. As soon as they start to bubble,
    add the coconut milk. Bring it to the boil, then turn off the heat.\r\nTo make
    the naans, melt the butter in a large non-stick ovenproof frying pan on a medium
    heat, then add the cloves and cinnamon stick.\r\nTrim the leek and quarter lengthways,
    wash, finely slice and add to the pan, followed by the spinach. Stir regularly,
    until dark, dry and intense, then remove and leave to cool.\r\nPour the flour
    into a large bowl with a pinch of salt, make a well in the middle and add 1 mug
    (300ml) of water (using the same mug you used to measure your flour, a regular
    cup is fine) and 1 tablespoon of oil. Use a fork to gradually mix the flour into
    the liquid, until it gets too hard to mix.\r\nAt this point, use your clean floured
    hands to knead the dough on a flour-dusted surface for a couple of minutes, adding
    a little extra flour, if needed. You want it to be pliable so don\u2019t add
    too much flour, but it shouldn\u2019t be sticking to your work surface.\r\nNow,
    oil your surface, then stretch and push the dough out into a 30cm circle. Crumble
    the feta over the cool spinach mixture and mix together, then place in the middle
    of the dough, leaving a 5cm border at the edge.\r\nFold in the dough over the
    filling, patting it together as you go and sealing the filling inside, then pat
    out to just under 25cm. Wipe out your frying pan, then gently lift the naan into
    it.\r\nCook the naan at the bottom of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
    golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy in the middle.\r\nA few minutes before
    you\u2019re ready to serve, bring the sauce back to a simmer, then add all the
    roasted veg and the frozen peas, and simmer until the peas are cooked and the
    sauce is a good consistency.\r\nSlice up your naan and serve up with your curry
    at the table. Nice with a dollop of yoghurt and any chutney or pickles, if you
    like."
